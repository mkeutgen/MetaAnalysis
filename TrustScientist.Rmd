```{r setup, include=TRUE}
TrustScientist <- read_sav("Trust in Scientists.sav")
```

Following what we've done with objective knowledge dataset, we start by fitting a random effect model.
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
